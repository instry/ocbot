**ocbot** is an AI-native browser and your personal AI assistant. You can think of it as an open-source version of **Chrome + Gemini**, and an all-in-one version of **OpenClaw**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. AI Browser
*   **Open Source Chrome + Gemini**: AI capabilities are deeply integrated into the browser kernel, not just as a plugin.
*   **Freedom of Choice**: Freely switch between Large Language Models (LLMs). Supports mainstream cloud models as well as fully **local LLMs**, ensuring data privacy and control.
*   **Chrome Lossless Experience**: Retains the full Chrome experience. Easily import your Chrome data (bookmarks, history, passwords) and continue browsing without interruption.

### 2. AI Assistant
*   **OpenClaw-like Experience**: ocbot runs not only on your desktop but can also be interacted with remotely via mobile browsers or third-party IM apps.
*   **Always On**: Command your home browser to handle complex tasks remotely, wherever you are.
*   **Mobile Version**: Access ocbot on iOS/Android with a native Chrome-like experience. Sync your tabs and history seamlessly across devices.

### 3. RPA Killer
Achieve web automation with natural language—no coding required:
*   **Natural Language Control**: Simply tell the browser "Download all invoices" or "Monitor flight prices".
*   **Learn Once, Reuse Often**: After learning an operation flow once, AI converts it into an efficient execution path, **significantly saving Token costs** for future runs.
*   **Self-Healing**: Web UI changed? The AI uses visual understanding to automatically repair operation paths, ensuring continuous stable operation.
